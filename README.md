# 🍬 US Candy Distribution SQL Project

This project is a SQL-based data analysis case study on a fictional **US candy distribution** business. It simulates real-world reporting and insight extraction using relational data across multiple tables in PostgreSQL.

## 📚 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following 5 tables:

| Table Name        | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `candy_sale`      | Daily sales with sales, units, cost, and profit |

| `candy_target`    | Monthly or overall sales targets per product |
| `candy_factory`   | Information about factories producing the candies |
| `data_dictionary` | Metadata describing the schema              |
